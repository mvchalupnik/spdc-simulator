# spdc-simulator
Simulate count rates for SPDC (BBO bulk crystal).

TODO:
Basics
- fig out axes tick labels- check this
- Fix conditional probability plot (check scaling)

Extras
- Plot total output power as a function of theta_p and other params
- Make plot of sinc function with +/- Big omega

Coding style
- Don't pass omegap where unnecessary
- Kwargs instead of dict
- Remove unnecessary imports and other cleaning
- Enums and other reduction of duplicate code
- TODOs

- Can check pump beam size and even linewidth dependence... I was unsure about this!
