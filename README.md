# spdc-simulator
Simulate count rates for SPDC (BBO bulk crystal)

TODO:
- Type II noncollinear
- Plot total output power as a function of theta_p and other params
- Don't pass omegap where unnecessary
- Kwargs instead of dict
- Remove unnecessary imports and other cleaning

Either sampling issue: not enough points; or scaling issue with carrier wave.
